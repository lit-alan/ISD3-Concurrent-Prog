# ISD3 Concurrent Programming
This module is designed to equip learners with the advanced features required to build comprehensive Java applications

On completion of this module the learner will/should be able to
1. Develop innovative and customised solutions using Internationalization.
2. Select and implement measures to enable multithreading in order to make applications more
responsive and interactive.
3. Demonstrate a critical comprehension of applications developed in Java with networked support.
4. Deploy appropriate theory, practices and tools for the implementation of robust Java solutions.

The module is 100% assessed by continuous assessment of laboratory/workshop based assignments and assessments. The module will be delivered through a combination of lectures, lab-lectures and practical classes. The lectures and lab-lectures will drive the content which will then be reinforced in the practical classes. Self-directed learning will be strongly encouraged throughout this module.
